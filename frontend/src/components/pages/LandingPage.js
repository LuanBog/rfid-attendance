      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Different schools from other countries have already implemented new and advanced technologies to help them manage their class time efficiently, due to the demanding world of today. The use of RFID cards caught the attention of some researchers in tracking the attendance as well as keeping the learner's record. An attendance tracking device which can lessen the time consumed in taking the conventional method checking and to reduce the teachers' traditional and manual attendance monitoring and focus more on tracking and learning. this attendance tracking device will use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as the tracking device and powered by Arduino Uno which serves as the brain (controller) of the system instead of using the conventional Identification Card. The recorded attendance can be downloaded through Universal Serial Bus (USB). If this innovation will be permitted this can be use in each classroom for more refined attendance tracking and a separate RFID student Identification in the main gate in identifying legit student of this institution. </p>
